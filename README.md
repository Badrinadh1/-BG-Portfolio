- Progress Bar: A top-of-page progress bar indicates the user's scroll depth.
- Contact Links: Quick links to professional profiles and email.
- Organized Sections: Clear and concise sections for a clean overview of skills and experience.

->Technologies Used

The project is built using the following core technologies:

- HTML5: For the semantic structure of the website.
- CSS3: For all styling, animations, and responsive design. The CSS utilizes variables for easy theme management.
- JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive elements, scroll animations, and dynamic content.

 Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
Your code is a very well-structured and aesthetically pleasing portfolio website. It effectively showcases a full-stack developer's skills and experience. The code is functionally sound, and the design is clean and modern.

You have included a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which is exactly what's needed for a complete web page. The use of a separate CSS file (style.css) and JavaScript file (script.js) is excellent for maintainability and best practice.

Here is a breakdown of the code and a detailed README file for your GitHub repository.

Code Review and Analysis
HTML: Your HTML is semantic and uses appropriate tags for different sections (<header>, <section>, <footer>, etc.). The use of IDs and classes is clear and purposeful for styling and JavaScript functionality.

CSS: The CSS is well-organized with the use of custom properties (:root) for color and font management, which makes the theme easy to customize. The animations and hover effects are subtle and professional, adding a modern feel without being distracting.

JavaScript: The JavaScript is clean and concise. The functions for opening links (linkedinlink, githublink, openmail) are a good way to manage external links. The createParticles and updateProgressBar functions are a nice touch that adds dynamic visual elements to the page. The IntersectionObserver is a sophisticated and efficient way to handle fade-in animations as the user scrolls, which is much better for performance than using a scroll event listener.

README.md
A good README file is crucial for a GitHub repository. It explains what the project is, how to use it, and what's included. Here is a professionally written README for your portfolio project, which you can copy and paste into a new file named README.md in your repository's root directory.
